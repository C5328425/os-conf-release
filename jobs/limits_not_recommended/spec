name: limits_not_recommended

description: |
  This job is not recommended. Firstly, it blindly copies in a configuration
  file with no error-checking, potentially causing deployment failures.
  Secondly, it encourages the increase of system limits to work around
  broken BOSH jobs, when effort is better spent fixing the BOSH jobs (e.g.
  increasing `nofile` to get around a faulty long-running BOSH job that leaks file
  descriptors and finally fails).

      Linux `limits.conf` file https://linux.die.net/man/5/limits.conf'
      Does not overwrite the existing limits.conf file; instead, it installs
      a secondary limits.conf file in `/etc/security/limits.d/`.
